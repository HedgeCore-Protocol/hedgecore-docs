# Abstract

StoneYield operates as a decentralized yield optimization protocol built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), introducing soul-bound hedged tokens for secure capital deployment. At its core lies STUSD, an immutable token generated through a 1:1 USDC deposit mechanism that delivers consistent returns via Venus Protocol integration.

The protocol's distinctive approach enforces wallet-specific time-locks with mandatory manual release procedures, eliminating token mobility throughout the staking duration. This design philosophy neutralizes common DeFi vulnerability vectors such as flash loan exploits and circular farming strategies, simultaneously strengthening the bond between participants and their capital positions.

Revenue generation occurs transparently via Venus Protocol's lending infrastructure, where the protocol captures a 7% performance fee. Participants retain 93% of generated yields, establishing sustainable economics without dependence on token emissions. Supplementary incentives may flow through governance-approved minting operations.

Addressing liquidity requirements without compromising security, StoneYield introduces sUSDC (StoneYield USDC), a freely tradeable ERC20 wrapper encapsulating STUSD positions. This dual-token architecture enables market access through sUSDC exchange on decentralized platforms while the underlying STUSD continues accruing yields. Emergency recovery mechanisms through KYC-verified operations provide additional user protection layers.

StoneYield represents a security-focused staking infrastructure merging soul-bound token principles with proven yield strategies, achieving equilibrium between capital preservation, sustainable returns, and liquidity access via the sUSDC wrapper ecosystem.
